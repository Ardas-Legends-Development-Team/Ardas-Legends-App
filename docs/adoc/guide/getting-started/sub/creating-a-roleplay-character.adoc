=== Creating a Roleplay Character
Before you can actually engage in roleplay, you will need to create a character.

This is done by writing a roleplay application on the discord server. Said application needs to be accepted by staff. As soon as that happened, one
of the staff members will create a roleplay character for you with the command:

[source]
----
    /create rpchar [name] [title] [gear] [pvp]
----
.Create RpChar Command
====
[source]
----
    /create rpchar Belegorn [title] [gear] [pvp]
----
====
WARNING: The above command can be only done by staff members

TIP: Your roleplay character will be created in the home region of your faction

Congrats! Now you have full access to all the roleplay commands and start with your journey!
