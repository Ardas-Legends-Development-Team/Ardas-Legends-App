== Before you continue

At first, we need to clarify some things about this guide.
Most of the time the commands will be displayed in their actual syntax, for example:

.Register Command
====
[source]
----
/register [ign] [faction-name]
----
====

The words inside the ``[]`` brackets are **parameters**, so inputs you give the command. Do not input stuff **with** the brackets, they are only used here
for explanation purposes!

Most of the time the inputs are self-explanatory, but if you at some point do not know what to write, read the description of the input
or ask the devs/staff.
Most of the error messages the bot returns are very clear about what went wrong. However, if you have issues with commands
or encounter an unexpected error message/disfunction of the bot, ***PLEASE CONTACT THE DEVS***!
