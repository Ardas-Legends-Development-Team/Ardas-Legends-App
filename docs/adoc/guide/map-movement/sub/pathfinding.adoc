=== Pathfinding

When you create a movement, the application will automatically calculate the fastest way to your destination.

TIP: If you want to go a specific path which is not the fastest path to your destination, just split up your movement
into multiple movements.

IMPORTANT: IF YOU NOTICE A BUG OR A MOVEMENT PATH DOES NOT GET CALCULATED CORRECTLY, PLEASE CONTACT THE DEVS!
