=== Moving Roleplay Characters

While being mostly the same, there are some differences between movements of armies and roleplay characters:

* Roleplay characters move twice as fast as armies
* RP-Chars can move through all regions, whether or not they are claimed.
* You do not need to pay for RP-Char movements.
