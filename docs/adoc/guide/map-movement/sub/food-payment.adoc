=== Food Payment

Before you can move an army, you need to pay food in order for the movement to succeed.

Generally you need to pay *9 stacks of food* for *1 day* of moving.
The payment food must be put into pouches and then handed over at the *payment area*. Refer to the link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XqMzhv3kFzISpDWdPIEqG4nQRZzGpzCP[War Guide]
to see which food is allowed for payment.

The bot has a stockpile system which allows you to pay for movements beforehand. As soon as staff finds food in your faction's chest at the
payment area, they will add this food to your faction's stockpile.

NOTE: When you move an army, the bot will check if there is enough food in your faction's stockpile. Always try to have enough food in your stockpile
so you can move your armies freely!
